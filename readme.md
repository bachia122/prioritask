# PrioriTask : CS50x Final Project
PrioriTask is a simple web application inspired by the Eisenhower Decision Matrix, a simple but effective time management strategy for sorting your tasks according to importance and urgency.
This way, you can rapidly identify which tasks to focus on, along with the ones you should ignore.

## Functionality
The web app features a login and registration functions akin to the Finance Pset.
An "apologetic" meme, shown for pointing out any errors, is different, but very relevant.

### 4 Task Categories:
~ Important and Urgent ("DO NOW")
~ Important ("SCHEDULE")
~ Urgent ("ASSIGN")
~ neither Important nor Urgent ("ELIMINATE")
Important tasks have a datepicker option for incorporating a date.
Urgent tasks have an extra textbox for adding the name your delegate.
Note that these extras need not be filled in to be able to add the task.

## How to Use
To add a new task, simply click on the desired category.
When you've accomplished a task, or simply want to delete it, you can either click the button below the task lists, or (if your lists get too long) click the "Delete a Task" in the navigation bar.
