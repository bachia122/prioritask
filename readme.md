# PrioriTask : CS50x Final Project
PrioriTask is a simple web application inspired by the Eisenhower Decision Matrix, a simple but effective time management strategy for sorting your tasks according to importance and urgency.<br>
This way, you can rapidly identify which tasks to focus on, along with the ones you should ignore.

## Functionality
The web app features a login and registration functions akin to the Finance Pset.
An "apologetic" meme, shown for pointing out any errors, is different, but very relevant.

### 4 Task Categories:
~ Important and Urgent ("DO NOW")<br>
~ Important ("SCHEDULE")<br>
~ Urgent ("ASSIGN")<br>
~ neither Important nor Urgent ("ELIMINATE")<br>
Important tasks have a datepicker option for incorporating a date.<br>
Urgent tasks have an extra textbox for adding the name your delegate.<br>
Note that these extras need not be filled in to be able to add the task.<br>

## How to Use
To add a new task, simply click on the desired category.<br>
When you've accomplished a task, or simply want to delete it, you can either click the button below the task lists, or (if your lists get too long) click the "Delete a Task" in the navigation bar.

## Other

"I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."
