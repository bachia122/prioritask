<h2>How to Use PrioriTask</h2><br>

 <p class="lead">
<font color="red"><b>Pri</b></font><font color="green">ori</font><font color="blue">Ta</font>sk
is inspired by the Eisenhower Decision Matrix, <br>a simple but effective time management strategy for sorting your tasks according to <strong>importance</strong> and <i>urgency</i>.
</p>


<p>
 This way, you can rapidly identify which tasks to focus on, along with the ones you should ignore.
</p>



<p>To <strong>add</strong> a new task, simply click on the suitable category corresponding to its importance and urgency.<br>
Important tasks have an option for incorporating a date, <br>
while Urgent tasks have an option for adding the name your delegate. <br>

</p>

<p>When you've accomplished a task, or simply want to <strong>delete</strong> it,<br>
you can either click the button below the task lists, <br>
or (if your lists get too long) click the "Delete a Task" in the navigation bar.</p><br><br>
  <small>"I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."</small>
